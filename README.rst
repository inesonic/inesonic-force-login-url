========================
You can use this WordPress plugin to force users to the "/customer-sign-in"
slug rather than "/wp-login" during login.  Customers that attempt to
point their browser to "/wp-login" will be redirected.

To use, simply copy this entire directory into your WordPress plugins directory
and then activate the plugin from the WordPress admin panel.
